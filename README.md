The purpose of this project is to utilize and understand the SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) and Q-learning algorithms, which are fundamental in the field of reinforcement learning. Both are used to train RL agents to make optimal decisions in reward-based environments. Pre-programmed environments were utilized, and a respective analysis was conducted for each case.
